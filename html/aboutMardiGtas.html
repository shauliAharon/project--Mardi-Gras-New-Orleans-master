                                The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana,
                                including the city of New Orleans. Celebrations are concentrated
                                for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, the day
                                before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian
                                tradition). Usually there is one major parade each day (weather
                                permitting); many days have several large parades. The largest and
                                most elaborate parades take place the last five days of the Mardi
                                Gras season. In the final week, many events occur throughout New
                                Orleans and surrounding communities, including parades and balls
                            </p>

                            <p>The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and
                                Venice
                                in the 17th and 18th
                                centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional revelry of
                                "Boeuf
                                Gras," or fatted calf,
                                followed France to her colonies.
                            <p>
                                On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville
                                arrived
                                at a plot of ground 60
                                miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his men
                                realized it was the eve of the
                                festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane" (which is now
                                Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the
                                tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those
                                that
                                form our current Mardi Gras
                                krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and paraded
                                from
                                1711 through 1861. The
                                procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex
                                would parade with an actual
                                bull, draped in white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat
                                Tuesday.

                                New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was
                                celebrated
                                openly in New Orleans, but not
                                with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de
                                Vaudreuil, established elegant
                                society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish
                                colonial governing body. That
                                year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of
                                clubs and carnival organizations
                                formed in New Orleans.

                                By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and
                                horseback riders to celebrate Mardi
                                Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's members and
                                lent each event an exciting air
                                of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of
                                Comus, invoking John Milton's
                                hero Comus to represent their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New
                                Orleans
                                with dazzling floats (known
                                as tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also
                                the
                                first recorded account of
                                Mardi Gras "throws."

                                Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed
                                "Carnival
                                Edition" lithographs of
                                parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats were
                                always carefully guarded before
                                the procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and details could not be
                                clearly
                                seen. But beginning in 1886
                                with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these chromolithographs could be
                                produced in
                                full, saturated color,
                                doing justice to the float and costume designs of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and
                                B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these
                                designers' work was brought to life by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges
                                Soulie', who for 40 years was
                                responsible for creating all of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to
                                preside
                                over the first daytime
                                parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen
                                introduced
                                Romanoff's family colors of
                                purple, green and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for justice; gold
                                for
                                power; and green for faith.
                                This was also the Mardi Gras season that Carnival's improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease
                                to
                                Love," was cemented, due in
                                part to the Duke's fondness for the tune.
                            </p>

                                The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans instead of
                                France, culminating with Comus'
                                magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic
                                paper-mache'
                                animal costumes served as
                                the basis for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and local officials, including Governor
                                Henry Warmoth. In 1875,
                                Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday in
                                Louisiana, which it still is.</p>

                            <p>
                                Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from
                                private social clubs with
                                restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are completely
                                funded by their members, New
                                Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"</p>
